        <a href="./first.html">specialized agency of the United Nations</a>
        a responsible for international public health.The WHO Constitution, which establishes the agency's governing
        structure and principles, states its main objective as "the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible
        level of health". It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with six semi-autonomous regional offices and 150
        field offices worldwide.

      <br /><font color="ffffff">The WHO was established by constitution on 7 April 1948, which is commemorated as World Health Day. The
      first meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the agency's governing body, took place on 24 July 1948.</font> The WHO
      incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the Office
      International d'Hygiène Publique, including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).[5] Its work began
      in earnest in 1951 following a significant infusion of financial and technical resources.<br /><br />

        The<abbr title="world health organization"> WHO</abbr> broad mandate includes advocating for universal healthcare, monitoring public health risks,
        coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting human health and well being.[7] It provides
        technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards and guidelines, and collects data on
        global health issues through the World Health Survey. Its flagship publication, the World Health Report,
        provides expert assessments of global health topics and health statistics on all nations.[8] The WHO also serves
        as a forum for summits and discussions on health issues.

            ><font size="10">The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the
            eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current
            priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis;
            non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security;
            occupational health; and substance abuse.</i

        As part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group, the WHA, composed of representatives from all 194
        member states, serves as the agency's supreme decision-making body. It also elects and advises an executive
        board made up of 34 health specialists. The WHA convenes annually and is responsible for selecting the
        director-general, setting goals and priorities, and approving the WHO's budget and activities.
      </p>
      The current director-general is Tedros Adhanom, former health minister and foreign minister of Ethiopia, who began
      his five-year term on 1 July 2017.[9] The WHO relies on contributions from member states (both assessed and
      voluntary) and private donors for funding. Its total approved budget for 2020–2021 is over $7.2 billion, of which
      the majority comes from voluntary contributions from member states.[1][10] Contributions are assessed by a formula
      that includes GDP per capita. Among the largest contributors were Germany (which contributed 12.18% of the
      budget), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (11.65%), and the United States (7.85%)
